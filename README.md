# WatchdogFilesChecker

One of the most popular videos on my channel was how to monitor a single folder using Watchdog. I received quite a few comments and emails asking how to monitor multiple folders, so I created this code. It used multi-processing to run multiple watchdog observers.

All the other libraries are standard except for watchdog.

pip install watchdog
